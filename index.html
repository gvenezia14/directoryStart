     <p> "I want to recommend Elephant Rock State Park. I visited the park this past summer with my friends. We spent the day climbing on the
        giant rocks and exploring the forest. There are some remnants of the old quarry transport there whhich was fun to see.
       Afterwards, we headed over to the Johnson’s Shut-Ins which is just 25 drive away. The water
        was very cool and refreshing. Many people rode down the rapid water which was very exciting. But if you want a peaceful, safe
        swim, that can be found as well. All in all an amazing day! It could have been even better if we camped for the night."
